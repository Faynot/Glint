Glint is a lightweight interpreted programming language written entirely in Rust. It is designed to be incredibly simple, user-friendly and lightning fast, surpassing languages such as Python in performance by 10 times, and faster than Java by 2 times - in certain benchmarks.

### Features:
- **Interpreted:** Glint is designed to be interpreted, making it easy to run and debug code without compilation steps.
- 
- **Error Handling:** With a beautiful and user-friendly error handler, Glint provides clear feedback when something goes wrong.

- **Simplicity:** It's simpler than any existing language, with a straightforward syntax and structure that encourages readability and ease of understanding.


- **Performance:** Despite its simplicity, Glint is optimized for speed, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.

  - *Comparison:* Glint is significantly faster than Python and competes closely with other popular languages like JavaScript, Java and Ruby in speed tests.
  
  - **Safety:** Glint has sufficient functionality to ensure sufficient security of your computer resources, due to the grammatical work in Rust.

  - **Dynamic Typing:** Glint embraces dynamic typing, allowing flexibility without the need for explicit type annotations.
